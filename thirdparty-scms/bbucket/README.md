# Serverless Data Lake Framework (ljhdatalake)

## BitBucket

![diagram](SDLF+BitBucket.jpg "Modification")

1. The foundations stacks are still created from the deploy script
2. The git mirroring, and the team repositories creation is delegated to BitBucket using the next features:
    1. An user and an [app-password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/): This allows to use a dedicated access from the pipelines to allow the team and pipelines repositories creation and execution.
    2. An AWS credentials access key and secret key (with the option to assume a specific role). This allows to create the repositories and commit by demand.
  These feature are triggered from the file bitbucket-pipelines.yml
3. The **app_password** and **bitbucketuser** parameters are stored as pipeline variables for the  prefix-ljhdatalake-team repository.
4. The **ljhdatalake_\*** parameters are stored in the Workspace Variables ([source](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/variables-and-secrets/) section *Workspace Variables*) from Bitbucket, in order to be avalaible for the pipelines in a secured way.

## Prerequisites:

1. An [app-password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/) with the next permissions:
    - Repositories: Read, Write, Admin
    - Pipelines: Read, Write, Edit variables
2. The pipelines feature should be [enabled](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines/) in Bitbucket
3. An IAM user (or role) with the next policy attached:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "codecommit:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:codecommit:*:*:ljhdatalake-*"
        }
    ]
}
```
